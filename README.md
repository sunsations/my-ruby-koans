=============

My solution to the ruby koans, which is an excellent introduction
to the Ruby language in a test driven manner.

My setup
--------
In order to run the test continuously, use the provided
bash script ./executeCommandEveryXSeconds.sh and
start it in separate terminal.

To run the test every 2 seconds, run
`./executeCommandEveryXSeconds.sh  "ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb" 2`
